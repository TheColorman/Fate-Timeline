# Fate Timeline
The Fate series has a notoriously complicated timeline, so I decided to create an interactive web version loosely based on [this](https://i.redd.it/6fz5fzz6sfv11.png) image by [u/Draconix814](https://www.reddit.com/user/Draconix814/) on Reddit.  
(You can find the live project page [here](https://thecolorman.github.io/Fate-Timeline/).)  
Still in development, we'll see how it goes.
